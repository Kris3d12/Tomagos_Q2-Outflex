<p>
Now whether the difficulty is real or whether it is imaginary, the results are the same. 
You become whatever you think. If God is with you, how can you possibly feel inferior to anyone. 
You have access to all the good that comes from God. You can demonstrate your faith in His ability to give it to you by 
living His life. So change your thought patterns right now. Have faith in God and you will have the courage to face anything.
