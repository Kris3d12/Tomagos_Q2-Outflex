            The Idlers and the Fools I am not a typical child. I was born 2 months earlier than my supposed birth month. 
            Born on March 5th 2011 through cesarean section in a catholic hospital in Santa Mesa Manila. 
            Though I was a preemie baby, I had a strong bones and a very healthy physique, 
            The pediatrician told my parents that I could be either extremely smart or I could be part of the abnormal spectrum. 
            So the doctor's decide to place me in an incubator for a month under observation and considered to be in intensive care. <br> <br>

            My mom never thought less but instead she trust God with his will and prayed that I will grow fast since I was a toothpaste tube size baby too small 
            for nurses and doctors professional observation. 
            But still mom is eager to make me grow normal and strong. In the hospital I was known as the miracle baby after a month of observation. 
            All my lab works came out normal and I was already a little bigger now size of a 1.5 liter pop soda. <br> <br>
            
            And so, at the age of One I can speak the language well. No baby talk, my mom always talk to me in a normal way and so it was easy for me to learn to talk. 
            I was not a sickly baby despite of my being a premature. I am always fascinated on robots and gadgets and also the constellation. 
            Everytime my mom and I goes out of the house and enjoy the open air, she always tell me stories about the constellation and how they symbolize star-crossed lovers, 
            About the gods and goddesses. 
            This inspired me to dream about going to the moon and see how great and wonderful God's creation.</p> </font> </div>

                      <h4>Tyler, The Creator</h4>
                    <p>Tyler, The Creator burst onto the scene with the controversial, raw energy of his early music and the Odd Future collective. Over the years, he has evolved into one of the most creative minds in hip-hop. Albums like Flower Boy, IGOR, and Call Me If You Get Lost showcase his growth, blending jazz, rap, and funk with introspective and sometimes surreal themes. Known for his vibrant production and eccentric style, Tyler has carved out a unique space in music, fashion, and even festival culture with his Camp Flog Gnaw event. His bold artistic vision continues to push boundaries.</p>
